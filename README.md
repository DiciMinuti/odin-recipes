# odin-recipes

In this project I will prove and integrate all the learning outcomes from the HTML basics TOP course.

The assignment of this task is to create a website that "will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes."

Write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. 

Do a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.
